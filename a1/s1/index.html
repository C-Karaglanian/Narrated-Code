	 Professor:  Cary Jardin
        		
Note: this is my first time programming using javascript and html!!

Program Description: 
Upon loading, the program displays a title, instructions, a text box with a notes in the text box, 
sends sounds associated with the notes inside the text box to the user audio, and a text box containing html code that
can be copied and pasted to a separate html file in the same folder and play whatever sounds that were requested in the 
text box with the notes.  The user has the ability to change and play different notes to suit their desired ordering of 
the notes.  The user can include a digit 0-9 in front of each note to increase the number of times the particular note 
plays.  The user can also include multiple notes on  the same line. Additionally, some aesthetic elements were added to 
increase the visual appeal of the program.

Program limitations:  
The input in the text box containing the notes must either be a space or be within the range of the digits 0-9 or the 
letters A-D or a-d.  Two additional limitations are that each letter can only have one digit in front of the letter 
and that the letters or digit and letter must be inside the text box in descending order in order to be played-this 
"descending order limitation" is part of the professor's introduction for this assignment and is also consistent with 
how music is displayed on a page of musical notes.  Unlike a musical note page, however, the input inside the text box 
is not designed to see different notes going from left to right on the same level as occuring after notes below that 
level, rather the next note is read on each level from left to right and then read on the next level left to right, 
continuing on until the bottom of the text box is reached.  If input inside the note text box is out of range of these 
restrictions, the user will receive an OutOfRange error letting the user know that they have incorrect input in the text 
box.  Also, the user must wait until the notes on the screen have played completely through before pressing the play button
or they will hear notes being played at the same time.
