Note: this is my second time (version 2 of Player Piano) programming a program using javascript and html!!

Program Description: 
Upon loading, the program displays a title, an instruction button to display instructions, a text box with variables assigned
to .mp3 files and those variables on separate line which instructs Player Piano to play the sound files associated with those
variables. The second text box contains html code that can be copied and pasted to a separate html file in the same folder and 
ran to play whatever sounds that were requested in the first text box.  The user has the ability to change and play a different 
ordering of the sound files according to how they program inside the text box.  The user can include a digit 0-9 in front of 
each note to increase the number of times the particular sound plays.  The user cannot include multiple variables on the same line
as of this iteration of Player Piano. Additionally, some aesthetic elements were added to increase the visual appeal of the program.

Program Parameters:  
The input in the text box for the assignment lines must contain a '.mp3' and a '='.  The first character of the variable cannot be
a digit.  Other than the '.' and the '=', no other non-alphanumeric characters can exist in this line.  Every character after the
first variable name can be a digit or a letter. Variable names are case sensitive.  
For lines that contain just variable names, a single digit 0-9 can be placed in front of the varible name to instruct Player Piano
to play the .mp3 file multiple times. Unlike a musical note page, the input inside the text box is designed to have only one assignment 
per line or one sound play request per line. If input inside the note text box is out of range of these restrictions, the user will 
receive an OutOfRange error letting the user know that they have incorrect input in the text box.  Also, the user must wait until 
the notes on the screen have played completely through before pressing the play button or they will hear notes being played at the same time.
When an error is thrown, the program tells the user what kind of error was made and which line the error was made on.

Other Notes:
The code below uses quite a bit of Regular Expressions--which were suggested as a challenge to get an A on the assignment.  This is my 
first foray into the use of Regular Expressions.
