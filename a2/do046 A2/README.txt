Hi Mr. Cary. For A2, I created an application that reads the user's .docx/.doc file
and keeps track how many times each word was used. With kanren, it suggests to the user
other synonynm words they could use instead. When the application completes, there will be a,
UPDATE_SYNONYM.txt file created, which contain words that are not found in my 
synonyms.txt file, which is a .txt file of synonym words. Also, a .txt file of the .docx
will be created, because it is used for analysis in the program. Hope it will all
make sense when you run the application. 

In addition to the kanren package, you also have to pip install docx2txt to use my application.
The documentation can be found on: https://pypi.org/project/docx2txt/

Lastly, I provided a .docx file in the directory, so you do not have to provide your
own.
